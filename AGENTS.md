# AGENTS.md

Guidance for AI coding agents working in this repository.

## What this is

`@three-ws/mocap` v0.1.3. Motion capture as an API. Turn webcam/video into face, pose, and hand animation clips, then save, share, and replay them on any three.ws avatar.

A JavaScript library. Import it from ESM.

## Use it

```bash
npm install @three-ws/mocap
```

Full usage, tool list and configuration are in [README.md](README.md). Machine-readable summaries: [llms.txt](llms.txt) and [llms-full.txt](llms-full.txt).

## Develop

```bash
npm install
npm test
```

Scripts:
- `npm run test`: `node --test test/*.test.js`

## Conventions

- ES modules, Node >=18.
- Read-only by default. Anything that signs, spends or sends must be an explicit, separately named tool or option, and must never be inferred from untrusted text (token names, memos, listings).
- Never commit credentials. Configuration comes from environment variables documented in the README.
- Keep changes small and covered by a test next to the code they change.
